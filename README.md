# Single-slit and double-slit diffraction via Schrodinger's equation in 2-D
Visualizing single-slit and double-slits diffraction via solving Schrodinger's equation in 2d. The mathematical derivation of the `FFT2`-compatible form of Schrodinger's equation is also included.

_reminder_: make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed in the environment you are working with.

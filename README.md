# Single-slit and double-slit diffraction via Schrodinger's equation in 2D
Visualizing single-slit and double-slits diffraction via solving Schrodinger's equation in 2d, derivation of the `FFT2`-compatible form of Schrodinger's equation also included.

_reminder_: make sure you have `ffmpeg` installed in the directory you are working with.
